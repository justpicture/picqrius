        <p>All nail growth occurs at the nail’s base, where the specialized cells that make up the nail’s plate are produced; As the root grows, the nail streams down along the nail bed and adds material to the underside of the nail to make it thicker. The matrix, sometimes called the matrix unguis, keratogenous membrane, nail matrix, or onychostroma, is the active tissue (or germinal matrix) that generates cells, which harden as they move outward from the nail root to the nail plate.</p>
