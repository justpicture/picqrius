    <p>Acrylic nails have been around for decades, but they’ve had a resurgence in recent years thanks to a combination of celebs, instagram, and our collective nail art obsession. It is worth considering the fact that prolonged wearing of acrylic leads to a thinning of the natural plate, and rehabilitation therapy are required after removal. The cost increases depending upon the length, choice of color, and shape and can go up to as high as $120. Butterfly nails are a fun, colorful trend from the 90s that is making a big comeback and making our hearts beat faster! Great for those looking to add length and strength to their nails.</p>
