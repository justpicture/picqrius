        <p>My model had quite long hair, so the way i styled it for my 1920s look was by tucking the bottom half up into a bob and pinning it underneath, i left the top section out and curled it with a large curling tong, moulding and pinning each crest in place as i went. Even in the 1920s, long hairstyles with braids were highly fashionable, whether women used them only to decorate their hairdos or to create elaborate hairstyles. The bob was perhaps the most popular among hairstyles for short hair.</p>
